	forward propagation 

	calculation of loss

	backward propagation

defining  the forward fucntion first and backward fucntion is automatically defined using backprop

any of the tensor operations can be used in forward pass

Chamfer distance: This loss function measures the distance between two point clouds by computing the minimum distance
 between each point in one cloud and its nearest neighbor in the other cloud. It is commonly used as a loss function
  for point cloud registration and reconstruction tasks.

Earth Mover's Distance (EMD): This loss function is similar to the Chamfer distance, but instead of computing the
 minimum distance between each point and its nearest neighbor, it computes the minimum cost of transforming one point 
 cloud into the other by moving each point a certain distance. It is commonly used as a loss function for point cloud
  generation tasks.

Repulsion loss: This loss function encourages the points in a point cloud to be evenly distributed by penalizing the
 distance between nearby points. It is commonly used as a regularization term in conjunction with other loss functions.

F-score loss: This loss function is based on the F-score metric, which measures the harmonic mean of precision and
 recall. It is commonly used as a loss function for point cloud segmentation tasks.
